                <p>
                    I love technology--using it, building it, but most of all watching others benefit.
                    I became a computer scientists because I enjoy solving problems with computers. I like to think software languages and frameworks are my paintbrushes.
                    As I near the end of my dissertation, it's clear that my passion involves painting healthcare technology that solves problems, with a user-centered design approach.
                    There are so many ways to go about this. I'm using mixed reality, sensors, 3D models, 3D printing, and entrepreneurship to understand and commercialize new ways to treat cardiac disease. Along the way, I'm absorbing as much as I can about machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop decision support systems that improve clinical outcomes.

                    When I was younger I wanted to be an architect. Legos and K'Nex were my entry into creativity. When I think about the structures I built then it reminds me of why I love building software. There's something special about using the manifestation of a dream, and the things you learn along the way. My foundation is at the University of Michigan where I learned fundamentals (Go Blue!!!). Shortly after I began working at Microsoft where I learned about my love for language, how teams function, how to be a valuable contributor, and how to build end-to-end services, among many other things. I'm in my final year of the Biomedical and Health Informatics PhD program at the University of Washington where I've applied what I've learned to build a mixed reality based catheterization simulator built on a custom RESTflull 3D modeling service. During it all I've had fantastic experiences learning from others, teaching and collaborating, and I look forward to what's ahead. My mission over the next few months is to open source my dissertation work so others can benefit like I've benefitted from the open source community. I'm excited to contribute a secure and extendable 3D model service, and a mixed reality cardiac catheterization simulator. I enjoy building relationships, building teams and building tools, and I can't wait to create what's next.

                    Helping people with technology has always been an interest of mine, but when I helped a family understand their daughters's disease using a custom built virtual reality application (video below) something in me changed. I like to imagine the feeling was similar to that which an artist feels when their message reaches someone else. The idea that technology can help us understand what's inside us, give people access to care, and improve clinical outcomes is part of what drives me, and is fueled by the mountains of unused, potentially life-saving data thats ignored, or worse, deleted, in hospitals around the world on a daily basis. Discovering novel ways to make data more useful has become a passion. My current works preserves the 3-dimensionality of data produced during cardiac catheterizations to better understand how mixed reality can facilitate minimally invasive therapies (videos below).

                I plan to build a successful company that researches, develops and commercializes innovative healthcare technologies. Commercialization is important to me because it's a vehicle for bringing new ideas from bench to the bedside of patients who need it. I've learned many lessons over the years, including the importance of understanding the market and stakeholders early. In 2016, I co-founded a company named Pear Med where we developed a virtual reality based surgical planning tool (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1NS6GyttLg" target="_blank">video</a>). We failed, in part, because we didn't understand our market. I reflected on these important lessons before co-founding Pyrus, where we have an innovative solution for a lage acess to care problem.

                33 million people suffer from atrial fibrillation (AFib) every year, yet only 5% of elidgeable patients receive the definitive treatment--cardiac ablation. This is an important issue to address because AFib can lead to a stroke, heart attack and premature death, and it effects older adults--a population that will continue to grow over time. At <a href="http://www.pyrusmedical.com" target="_blank">Pyrus</a>, we're developing a suitecase sized electrophysiology lab so ablations can be performed in rural areas, where most patients live, not just in big cities. I couldn't be more excited about our mission and the potential impact we can have on the world. I will update this description as we learn more through market research.

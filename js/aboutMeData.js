var researchSummary = "My latest research explores ways to improve medical education, procedural planning and procedural guidance using mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), sensors and 3D printing. Learning and working in MR/VR opens up new dimensions for input, and adds a spatial element to experiences that can make things easier to understand and remember. 3D printing offers a physical medium that can be visualized and augmented with VR and MR to create incredible experiences. I'm really excited about the opportunities that these technologies unlock.";

A catheter ablation is the definitive treatment for an arrhythmia, but its high failure rate and expensive equipment limit its quality and reach.
